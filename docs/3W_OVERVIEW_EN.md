# üõ¢Ô∏è Petrobras 3W Project Overview

> **üáßüá∑ [Ver em Portugu√™s Brasileiro](3W_OVERVIEW.md)**

## üìã Introduction

The **3W Project (Three Worlds)** is Petrobras' first public repository on GitHub, launched on May 30, 2022. It represents a strategic initiative to promote experimentation and development of Machine Learning-based approaches for specific problems related to detection and classification of undesirable events that occur in offshore oil wells.

## üéØ Why "3W"?

The name **3W** was chosen because this dataset is composed of instances from **3** different sources and which contain undesirable events that occur in oil **W**ells.

## üöÄ Motivation and Impact

### Industry Problems

- **Production Losses**: Undesirable events can cause up to **5% production losses** in certain scenarios
- **Maintenance Costs**: The cost of a maritime probe, required to perform various types of operations, can exceed **US$ 500,000 per day**
- **Safety**: Prevention of environmental accidents and human casualties
- **Integrity**: Monitoring of well integrity and subsea systems

### Expected Benefits

- **Improve the process** of identifying undesirable events in drilling, completion and production phases
- **Increase efficiency** of monitoring well integrity and subsea systems
- **Prevent losses** for people, environment and company image

## üèóÔ∏è Strategy and Governance

### Innovation Connections Program

The 3W is the first pilot of Petrobras' **"Conex√µes para Inova√ß√£o - M√≥dulo Open Lab"** program, composed of:

1. **3W Dataset**: Evolves and is supplemented with more instances over time
2. **3W Toolkit**: Evolves in many ways to cover an increasing number of undesirable events

### Governance

- **Leadership**: Flow Assurance department and research center (CENPES)
- **Expansion**: Since May 1st, 2024, includes the Well Integrity department
- **Evolution**: Project increasingly consolidated at Petrobras
- **Professionals**: More specialists in instance labeling
- **Tools**: More investment in digital tools for labeling and export

## üìä Project Resources

### 3W Dataset

- **First realistic and public dataset** with rare undesirable real events in oil wells
- **Format**: Parquet files with Brotli compression
- **License**: Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International
- **Structure**: Multiple Parquet files saved in subdirectories
- **Theory**: Based on the paper "A realistic and public dataset with rare undesirable real events in oil wells" (Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering)

### 3W Toolkit

- **Software package** written in Python 3
- **Facilitates**: Dataset overview generation, experimentation and comparative analysis
- **Standardization**: Key points of ML-based algorithm development pipeline
- **Arbitrary choices**: Carefully made to allow adequate comparative analysis
